## Merge sort

Merge sort is a recursive sort.  
It divides the data structure until it cannot be divided any further, that is, until each element is by itself.  
It then merges these small data structures, swapping elements before merging if they are incorrctly sorted.  
Its speed complexity is always O(nlogn).
