## Insertion sort

Insertion sort is a very simple algorithm.  
Its speed complexity is O(n*n).  

Imagine an array made of two part. The right part is unsorted and the left part is sorted.  
The algorithm iterates through the unsorted part of the array and compares the element with all the previous
elements in the left, sorted part.
