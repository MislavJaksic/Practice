## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions.  
When developing an algorithms it is important to first construct and test it on a piece of paper before using
your favourite language to execute it.  

### Search algorithms

Search algorithms search for data in data structures such as arrays or trees.  

Search algorithms:  
* linear search - data doesn't have to be sorted  
* binary search - data has to be sorted  

### Sorting algorithms

Sorting algorithms order data in an ascending or descending order.  

Quickly sorting large amounts of data is a common problem so many sorting algorithms have been developed.  
A few well known sorting algorithms are:  
* insertion sort
* merge sort
* quick sort
* Shell sort
